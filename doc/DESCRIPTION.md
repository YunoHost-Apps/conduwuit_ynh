Conduwuit is a lightweight open-source server implementation of the Matrix Specification with a focus on easy setup and low system requirements. That means you can make your own Conduit setup in just a few minutes.
Conduit keeps things simple, it's a single binary with an embedded database and can be much faster than other server implementations in some cases.
